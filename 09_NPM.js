GENERAL
-------

Node.js
-------
Javascript was created from Mozzila (NetScape) that was supposed to run
and exist in the browser as a scripting language.Node.js was originally written in 2009 by Ryan Dahl.

Node.js is using Google's V8 engine to interpret javascript code.
But due to JavaScripts popularity Dahl came up with node.js, an open source cross-platform runtime environment.
People really liked the idea that they can write front-end and back-end code  in the same language and node took of.
Programmers started producing vast amount of libraries and then in 2011 the NPM came to life to make it easier to
handle the modules and packages.


NPM
----
 Node Package Manager (npm) makes it easy for JavaScript developers
 to share and reuse code, and it makes it easy to update the code
 that you're sharing.

 In a project with many dependencies npm can be a life saver when it comes to
 updating packages, downloading new ones and removing no longer used ones with simple
 commands like npm update, npm install "package to be installed" or npm prune.

 In every Node project that uses many dependencies a package.json with information about the
 dependencies their version the entry point of an application.

 there you could right the commands to use your dependencies as you would do in the command line.
