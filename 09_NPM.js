 Node Package Manager (npm) makes it easy for JavaScript developers
 to share and reuse code, and it makes it easy to update the code
 that you're sharing.

 In a project with many dependencies npm can be a life saver when it comes to
 updating packages, downloading new ones and removing no longer used ones with simple
 commands like npm update, npm install "package to be installed" or npm prune.

 In every Node project that uses many dependencies a package.json with information about the
 dependencies their version the entry point of an application.

 there you could right the commands to use your dependencies as you would do in the command line.
